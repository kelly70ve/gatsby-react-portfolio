## About App

2020 has shifted how the Food & Beverage service industry conducts business. From masked staff & guests, to lower seating capacities & privacy bubbles. Ever changing health mandates continue to create new challenges for how service staff connect with their guests. 

Armonia has introduced a new chat and service app, which will help limit the amount of face to face interactions for staff, while still providing guests with excellent and safe service.
